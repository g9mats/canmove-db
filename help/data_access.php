<h4><b>Data Access</b></h4>
<p>
Anyone with an account in the CAnMove database can create projects and datasets. The creator can take care of the owner role of the object with permission to perform all operations. If another person is pointed out as the owner the creator automatically obtains the admin role instead. The only difference between the two is that the person with the admin role will not show up in listings which show the owner.
</p><p>
After that the owner or the admin can hand out roles to more persons in the submenu Administration. At the project level there is also a read role and at the dataset level there is both a read and a write role. The latter makes it possible to load data as well. A person needs to hold a role on the project level before  a role can be granted to a dataset in that project.
</p><p>
A person can only have one role per object. If you grant a person a new role the old one will be overwritten. But there can be any number of persons with the same role. If e.g. several researchers conduct the study together they can all get the credit as equal owners.
</p><p>
You can also revoke roles from persons. The system will see to that there will always be at least one person left with owner or admin rights. This means there will never be any abandoned objects.
