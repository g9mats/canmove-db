<h4><b>Nano Biology Lab Data Input</b></h4>
<p>
Data is loaded in the only existing data subset: Trackpoints.
A spreadsheet template can be downloaded from the database menu under Support - Download Template.
</p><p>
Data must have standarized headers that can be found in the menu as well: Support - List All Variables.
In the template file the headers are colour coded, one for each object.
Darker colours means the variable is mandatory and lighter means it is optional.
There is also help tags on the headers.
</p><p>
Headers can appear in any order.
It makes it easier to put the data in a logical order but the template can be seen as only a suggestion that might be helpful.
</p><p>
The intention is to transfer the Trackpoints the shortest way from the tracking equipment to the database with a mininum of manual efforts.
It is expected that the device dump routine produces one tab separated text file for the entire experiment.
So for the purpose of loading data to the database the template may only serve as a description of the data format.
There is no need to actually store data in spreadsheet format unless you need that for other reasons.
</p><p>
When uploading the file to the file server archive it must be tagged as final.
