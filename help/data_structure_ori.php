<h4><b>Orientation Data Structure</b></h4>
<p>
The Orientation module is used to store data from experiments where birds are held in cages during migratory season while observing their activities and in that way establish in which direction they strive.
</p><p>
This module consists of several data subsets.
The capture data subset contains the animal and capture objects while the experiment data is stored in a separate subset.
This information is often entered into a spreadsheets during capture and experiment activities or copied from paper notes afterwards.
</p><p>
The results from the experiments are collected in various ways.
At present there are two data subsets to support these data called count and estimation.
In the future there will be a need for more types of data subsets to support new automatic registration techniques using e.g. video cameras.
</p><p>
There is also a assessment data subset to be used if data is gathered unrelated to both capture and experiment activities.
